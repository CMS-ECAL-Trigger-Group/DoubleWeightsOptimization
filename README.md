# Double Weights Optimization 

The purpose of this repository is to optimize a second set of weights for the ECAL FENIX FIR filter. For more information, see slides 29-34 of: [[2 November 2020 - L1 TP meeting]](https://indico.cern.ch/event/970795/contributions/4087021/attachments/2134950/3596016/2_November_2020_ECAL_L1_DoubleWeights_forL1TP%20%281%29.pdf)

# TIPP 2021 plots producer 

This repository also contains the code used to create TIPP 2021 plots for double weights as shown on slides 15-22 of [this talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1033452/contributions/4345541/attachments/2244465/3812570/May_2021_ECAL_Trigger_Run3_ApprovalPlots_DPS_private.pdf). Plots include: 

- Fraction of spike timing PDF tagged by ODD weights 
- Plot of sets of 5 weights for different OOT cases
